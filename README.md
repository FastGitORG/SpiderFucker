# SpiderFucker

Before all, FUCK YOU, SPIDER!🖕🖕🖕

After FastGit been attacked by **bytespider**(Spider Bot from **ByteDance**) and consume **over 8 TiB** of bandwidth quota in **24 hours**, we found that not all the spiders obey the game rules. So that, we create this repository to record fucking spider bots.

## Components

- Block : The spider which does not follow the rules seriously.
- Neutral : We don't know or are not sure.
- Allow : This kinds of spider is good for the website.

## Way to use

1. Before all, clone this repository
1. Run `classify.ps1` on PowerShell(We recommend using PowerShell 5+)
1. Finally, you will get 3 files, that's it!
