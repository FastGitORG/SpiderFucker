# SpiderFucker

Before all, FUCK YOU, SPIDER!ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•

After FastGit been attacked by bytespider(Spider Bot from ByteDance) and consume over 8 TiB of bandwidth quota in 24 hours, we found that not all the spiders obey the game rules. So that, we create this repository to record fucking spider bots.

## Components

- Block : The spider which does not follow the rules seriously.
- Neutral : We don't know or are not sure.
- Allow : This kinds of spider is good for the website.
